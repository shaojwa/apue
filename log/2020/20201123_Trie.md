#### why it called trie
because the struct is created to RETRIEVE data. so it called TRIE tree.

#### advantages
1. There are no collisions of different keys in a trie.
1. Looking up data in a trie is faster in the worst case, O(m) time , compared to an imperfect hash table.
1. A trie can provide an alphabetical ordering of the entries by key.
1. There is no need to provide a hash function or to change hash functions as more keys are added to a trie.

#### drawbacks
1. Trie lookup can be slower than hash table lookup, especially if the data is directly accessed on a hard disk drive.
1. Some tries can require more space than a hash table.
1. Some keys, such as floating point numbers, can lead to long chains and prefixes.

#### optimization
1. For the space-optimized presentation of prefix tree, see compact prefix tree.
1. each trie can be compressed into a deterministic acyclic finite state automaton.
