#### systemd.exec - Execution environment configuration
```
man systemd.exec
```
Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a new /dev namespace for the executed processes and only adds API pseudo devices such as /dev/null, /dev/zero or
/dev/random (as well as the pseudo TTY subsystem) to it, but no physical devices such as /dev/sda.
