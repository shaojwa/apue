So we can now access all of the data we need for this function by using base pointer addressing using different offsets from %ebp. %ebp was made specifically for this purpose, which is why it is called the base pointer. You can use other registers in base pointer addressing mode, but the x86 architecture makes using the %ebp register a lot faster.
