#### builtin functions 
The following builtins are intended to be compatible with those described in the Intel Itanium Processor-specific Application Binary Interface, section 7.4. 


#### scalar
The definition given in the Intel documentation allows only for the use of the types int, long, long long as well as their unsigned counterparts.
GCC will allow any integral scalar or pointer type that is 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes in length.

#### barrier
In most cases, these builtins are considered a full barrier.
Further, instructions will be issued as necessary to prevent the processor from speculating loads across the operation and from queuing stores after the operation.
