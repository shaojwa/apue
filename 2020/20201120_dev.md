On most non-embedded Linux installations, and many embedded installations, /dev is on a RAM-backed filesystem, not on the root partition. Most current installations have /dev as a tmpfs filesystem, with the udev daemon creating entries when notified by the kernel that some hardware is available. Recent kernel offer the possibility of having /dev mounted as the devtmpfs filesystem, which is directly populated by the kernel.
