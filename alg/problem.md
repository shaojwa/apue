1. given n numbers, one of them appears once and the rest appears twice, so what is the number appears once.
1. given a array `a[n](n <= 100,000)`, you can operate any rounds. in each round, pick the index `i(1 < i < n)`, make `a[i] = a[i - 1] + a[i + 1] - a[i]`,
so what's the max of `a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[n]`
