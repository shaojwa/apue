块作用域（block variable）中带有`static`或者`thread_local`标记的，有静态存储期或者线程存储期（storage duration）。
```
Block variables with static or thread(since C++11) storage duration are initialized the first time control passes through
their declaration (unless their initialization is zero- or constant-initialization, which can be performed before
the block is first entered). On all further calls, the declaration is skipped.
```
